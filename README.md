Description:
The website is a single-page website for the fictitious fintech startup called "FinEdge." It is built using the Astro framework, which allows for modular development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website aims to showcase FinEdge's services in transforming cross-border payments. It follows responsive design principles to provide a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

The website consists of the following components:

Navigation bar: The navigation bar is located at the top of the page and includes links to different sections of the website, such as Home, About Us, Services, and Contact Us.

Home Section: The home section is the landing section of the website. It features a catchy headline and a brief description of FinEdge, along with a background image to create an attractive visual impact.

About Us Section: The about us section provides a brief background about FinEdge, emphasizing its focus on transforming cross-border payments and the belief that geographic boundaries should not limit transactions.

Services Section: The services section highlights three different financial services offered by FinEdge. Each service is presented with a relevant image/icon, a title, and a brief description. The services showcased are related to individual money transfers, business payments, and real-time tracking of payments.

Contact Us Section: The contact us section includes a simple contact form with fields for name, email, and a message. While the form is not functional, it provides an interactive element for users to enter their contact details and message.

Execution:
To execute the website code:

Set up an Astro project by installing the necessary dependencies and configuring the project structure.

Place the relevant images in a directory within the project (e.g., static/images) and update the image paths in the code accordingly.

Customize the content, styles, and any additional features as needed to align with the branding and design of FinEdge.

Run the development server using the appropriate command for the Astro framework (e.g., npm run dev).

Open a web browser and visit the local development URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000) to see the website in action. The website should be responsive and display the different sections, navigation bar, services, and contact form.

Test the website's responsiveness by viewing it on different devices or using browser developer tools to simulate various screen sizes.

That's it! You have now designed, developed, and executed the single-page website for FinEdge using the Astro framework.
